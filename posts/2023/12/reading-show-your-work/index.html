Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.&rdquo; —Steve Jobs</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But today, by taking advantage of the Internet and social media, an artist can share whatever she wants, whenever she wants, at almost no cost.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>By letting go of our egos and sharing our process, we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work, which helps us move more of our product.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>How can you show your work even when you have nothing to show? The first step is to scoop up the scraps and the residue of your process and shape them into some interesting bit of media that you can share. You have to turn the invisible into something other people can see.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share. Where you are in your process will determine what that piece is. If you’re in the very early stages, share your influences and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress. If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Social media sites are the perfect place to share daily updates.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don’t show your lunch or your latte; show your work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of course, don’t let sharing your work take precedence over actually doing your work. If you’re having a hard time balancing the two, just set a timer for 30 minutes. Once the timer goes off, kick yourself off the Internet and get back to work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>you want the work you post online to be copied and spread to every corner of the Internet, so don’t post things online that you’re not ready for everyone in the world to see.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Be open, share imperfect and unfinished work that you want feedback on, but don’t share absolutely everything.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The act of sharing is one of generosity—you’re putting something out there because you think it might be helpful or entertaining to someone on the other side of the screen.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you’re unsure about whether to share something, let it sit for 24 hours. Put it in a drawer and walk out the door. The next day, take it out and look at it with fresh eyes. Ask yourself, &ldquo;Is this helpful? Is it entertaining? Is it something I’d be comfortable with my boss or my mother seeing?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A blog is the ideal machine for turning flow into stock: One little blog post is nothing on its own, but publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Where do you get your inspiration? What sorts of things do you fill your head with? What do you read? Do you subscribe to anything? What sites do you visit on the Internet? What music do you listen to? What movies do you see? Do you look at art? What do you collect? What’s inside your scrapbook? What do you pin to the corkboard above your desk? What do you stick on your refrigerator? Who’s done work that you admire? Who do you steal ideas from? Do you have any heroes? Who do you follow online? Who are the practitioners you look up to in your field? Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who you are and what you do—sometimes even more than your own work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When you find things you genuinely enjoy, don’t let anyone else make you feel bad about it. Don’t feel guilty about the pleasure you take in the things you enjoy. Celebrate them. Being open and honest about what you like is the best way to connect with people who like those things, too.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you share the work of others, it’s your duty to make sure that the creators of that work get proper credit. Don’t share things you can’t properly credit. Find the right credit, or don’t share.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you’re sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it. Online, the most important form of attribution is a hyperlink pointing back to the website of the creator of the work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What if you want to share something and you don’t know where it came from or who made it? The answer: Don’t share things you can’t properly credit. Find the right credit, or don’t share.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work effects how they value it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The most important part of a story is its structure. A good story structure is tidy, sturdy, and logical. Sometimes we have to do a lot of cropping and editing to fit our lives into something that resembles a story.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, there was _____. Every day, _____. One day, _____. Because of that, _____. Because of that, _____. Until finally, _____.&rdquo; Pick your favorite story and try to fill in the blanks. It’s striking how often it works.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This simple formula can be applied to almost any type of work project: There’s the initial problem, the work done to solve the problem, and the solution.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whether you’re telling a finished or unfinished story, always keep your audience in mind. Speak to them directly in plain language. Value their time. Be brief. Learn to speak. Learn to write. Use spell-check. You’re never “keeping it real” with your lack of proofreading and punctuation, you’re keeping it unintelligible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You should be able to explain your work to a kindergartner, a senior citizen, and everybody in between. Of course, you always need to keep your audience in mind: The way you explain your work to your buddies at the bar is not the way you explain your work to your mother.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Teaching people doesn’t subtract value from what you do, it actually adds to it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you want fans, you have to be a fan first. If you want to be accepted by a community, you have to first be a good citizen of that community. If you’re only pointing to your own stuff online, you’re doing it wrong. You have to be a connector. Don’t waste your time reading articles about how to get more followers. Don’t waste time following people online just because you think it’ll get you somewhere. Don’t talk to people you don’t want to talk to, and don’t talk about stuff you don’t want to talk about. If you want followers, be someone worth following.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It’s that simple.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire. Of course, The Vampire Test works on many things in our lives, not just people—you can apply it to jobs, hobbies, places, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you’ve been friends for a while with somebody online and you live in the same town, ask them if they want to grab a coffee. If you want to go all out, offer to buy them lunch. If you’re traveling, let your online friends know you’re going to be in town.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Meeting people online is awesome, but turning them into IRL (in real life) friends is even better.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When you put your work out into the world, you have to be ready for the good, the bad, and the ugly. The more people come across your work, the more criticism you’ll face. You can’t control what sort of criticism you receive, but you can control how you react to it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you have work that is too sensitive or too close to you to be exposed to criticism, keep it hidden.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The first step in evaluating feedback is sizing up who it came from. You want feedback from people who care about you and what you do. Be extra wary of feedback from anybody who falls outside of that circle.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Do you have a troll problem? Use the block button on social media sites. Delete nasty comments.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The easiest way to do this is to simply ask for donations: Put a little virtual tip jar or a donate now button on your website. These links do well with a little bit of human copy, such as “Like this? Buy me a coffee.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Beware of selling the things that you love: When people are asked to get out their wallets, you find out how much they really value what you do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You’ll notice a pattern with technology—often the most boring and utilitarian technologies are the ones that stick around the longest. Email is decades and decades old, but it’s nowhere close to being dead.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s very important not to quit prematurely. If you look to artists who’ve managed to achieve lifelong careers, you detect the same pattern: They all have been able to persevere, regardless of success or failure.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Just do the work that’s in front of you, and when it’s finished, ask yourself what you missed, what you could’ve done better, or what you couldn’t get to, and jump right into the next project.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You have to have the courage to get rid of work and rethink things completely.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Look for something new to learn, and when you find it, dedicate yourself to learning it out in the open. Document your progress and share as you go so that others can learn along with you. Show your work, and when the right people show up, pay close attention to them, because they’ll have a lot to show you.</p></blockquote></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>更新于 2023-12-07&nbsp;<a class=git-hash href=https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt/commit/8e05361377f9be91d36a589225e3588f10eda962 target=_blank title="commit by Wang Huibin(fighter9010@gmail.com) 8e05361377f9be91d36a589225e3588f10eda962: edit post">
